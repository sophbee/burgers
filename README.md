# burgers

This assignment reviewed our coursework on Express Handlebars and setting up MVC frameworks for our full-stack applications. 

NPM Packages used: 
- body-parser
- express
- express-handlebars
- mysql

The application tracked any burgers added to the database - both on the client side and the server side - as well as any burgers that were "devoured" by clicking a button next to the name of the burger. New burgers started off on the left-hand side of the page and ended up on the right hand side, if devoured. All of the burger information was stored on MySQL as persistent data. This project was a bit challenging since it was my first time using the MVC framework to create a full-stack application.
